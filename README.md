## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Night Shift Pay Calculation

The system calculates night shift pay using the following formula:

```
nightShiftPay = nightShiftHours * hourlyRate * nightShiftMultiplier
```

Where:

- `hourlyRate` is calculated as `baseSalary / (standardDaysInMonth * standardHoursPerDay)`
- `nightShiftMultiplier` defaults to 1.3 if not specified, but can be customized per payroll
- The night shift multiplier is always ensured to be at least 1.0

### Validation

- The system validates that the night shift multiplier is a valid number and at least 1.0
- If night shift hours are present but no multiplier is specified, the default value of 1.3 is used
- The frontend ensures night shift multiplier is included in API requests when night shift hours exist

A test script is available to verify this calculation:

```
node test-night-shift.js
```

## Authentication System

The application uses a secure authentication system with JWT token-based authentication:

### Features

- Access tokens with short expiration time (15 minutes by default)
- Refresh tokens with longer expiration time (7 days by default)
- Token revocation capabilities

### Required Environment Variables

```
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=15m
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your-refresh-token-secret-key-here
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in with username/password and receives an access token and refresh token
2. The access token is used for authenticated API requests
3. When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token to obtain a new pair of tokens
4. The user can log out, which invalidates the refresh token

### API Endpoints

- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate and get tokens
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Get new tokens using refresh token
- `POST /auth/logout` - Invalidate refresh token
- `GET /auth/profile` - Get user profile (requires authentication)
